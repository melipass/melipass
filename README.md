# Hola ✨
I'm Melissa, my pronouns are she/her and they/them, and I'm a Computer Engineer from Santiago, Chile.

I love to travel, learn languages, and read books. You may find me at concerts or drinking tea.

👩🏻‍💻 Currently a CISO at [Fintual](https://fintual.com/) Prepago. Previously, a Security and Privacy Engineer at [Bending Spoons](https://bendingspoons.com/) and a Security Engineer at [Evernote](https://evernote.com/).

👩🏻‍🔬 Before working in security, I was part of Universidad Mayor's [Quantum Computing research group](https://www.diariomayor.cl/ciencia-um/docentes-y-estudiantes-crean-el-primer-grupo-de-computacion-cuantica-u-mayor.html), a Data Engineering and Data Science Intern at [Walmart Chile](https://github.com/walmartdigital/), and also did some High Performance Computing for Quantum Physics at the [Herrera Lab](http://fherreralab.com/).
